             <p class="type-about">1. Coffee Grinder Not Required <br>Similar to using instant coffee, the lack of a coffee grinder requirement is one of the main benefits of micro ground coffee. You donâ€™t need a coffee grinder at home because the beans have already been ground. Prepare your coffee in an instant! <br> 2. Flavorful and Aromatic <br>The only beans used to make this coffee are Arabica ones. Because of this, the flavor, taste, and scent of this particular coffee are quite fresh and strong. This coffee tastes fantastic anytime you drink it since the beans used to produce it are often freshly brewed.
